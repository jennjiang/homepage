    Hi! I'm Jenn, and I'm a designer with expertise working with interaction, experience, technology, and graphic design. I am currently pursuing a master degree integrating my skills in both Graphic and Interaction Design at CCA.
  </p><p>    I hold a bachelors degree of fine arts and product design from Shanghai Insitute of Technology, where I was a vice president of the student union. I have certification from the Southampton Solent University program focused on Graphic design and was a graphic design intern at Centdegres.  
  </p><p>    I’m currently learning web development and exploring more about UI/UX design. I'm a graduate teaching assistant at CCA helping students with troubleshooting HTML and CSS. Meanwhile, I’m working as a grad studio assistant manager helping with graphic design content for the studio, including studio calendar, sign-up sheet, posters, etc. 
  </p><p>    I’m looking for a summer 2019 internship opportunity. Feel free to email me with any questions and inquires!
    </p>
